# Coin-Collecting-Robot
Autonomous coin collecting robot which detects and collects coins within an AC wire perimeter. Coin detection system utilizes a tank circuit to measure the resonant frequency allowing a robotic arm consisting of servo motors and an electromagnet to respond and pick up the coin. Robot movement is controlled by a motor control circuit using PWM signals.
